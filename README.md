### ⭐️ Looking for collaborators ⭐️
We're looking for people to come and help work on the latest challenge **Coinbee**. If you're interested, get in touch via our slack community or via my website 

&nbsp;
## What are the challenges for?
They could be:
- Short coding exercises, for use in interviews with candidates
- Ways for you to test yourself / test your coding abilities under pressure
- Fun exercises to help you learn React 

&nbsp;
## How do they work / how do I get started?
The scaffolding of each challenges / app is done for you and each challenge has *create-react-app* as its foundation.

- Clone the whole challenges repository
- Run `yarn` or `npm install` in any of the individual challenge directories to install dependencies
- Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the application on port 3000 (CRA default)
- Each challenge has a README with requirements for you to complete

*Some challenges might require usage of external APIs, but all information will be provided in the individual challenge readme.*

&nbsp;
#### Why are the solutions invite only?
People use these challenges for interviews. By putting the solutions behind a collaboration wall / invite-only repository we can discourage candidates from simply looking up the solutions.

&nbsp;
## Why does it take so long for updates / new challenges?
I work on these challenges & solutions in my spare time, on top of a full time job and everything else that comes in life. Because of this, I don't always get a lot of time to maintain and add new challenges. Interested in becoming a collaborator or submitting your own challenge? **Reach out below or submit a new challenge!**

### What Makes A Good Challenge?
- Clear requirements
- Fun and engaging
- Accurate difficulty level
- Looks good (visually pleasing)
- Realistic -- would someone ever need to build something like this in real life?
- Easy to get started (minimal pre-requisites)
